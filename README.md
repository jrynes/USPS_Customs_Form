# USPS Customs Form
A Python script using Selenium and tkinter to batch-create USPS customs shipping forms.

## Project Description
When mailing multiple packages, navigating the USPS customs web form becomes a time-intensive task.

To help streamline the process, this method allows the user to select multiple recipients, and create USPS customs forms in a batch method.

## Getting Started

### Set up your Sending Address, and Recipients

To get started:
* Change your sender address to match your home address
* Update the Receiver addresses to include who you would like to send a package to

**Below is a sample copy of the CSV file with addresses, for some context:**

|Address Type|Name     |Street Address|City    |State    |Zip Code|Country|
|------------|---------|--------------|--------|---------|--------|-------|
|Sender      |Test Name|Test Address  |TestTown|TestState|“01234” |USA    |
|Receiver    |Test Name|Test Address  |TestTown|TestState|“01234” |USA    |
|Receiver    |Test Name|Test Address  |TestTown|TestState|“01234” |USA    |

<!-- 
### Executing the Code

TODO: Add some description here to help tell the user how to run their code

### Original text description is below

A CSV file that includes the sender's address and a set of recipients accompanies the python files.

This CSV file functions as an address book, where the user can input a full list of potential recipeints.

Later in the python dialogs, the user has the ability to select a subset of this full list of recipients to send a package.
