# USPS Customs Form
A Python script using Selenium and tkinter to batch-create USPS customs shipping forms.



## Project Description
When mailing multiple packages, navigating the USPS customs web form becomes a time-intensive task.

To help streamline the process, this method allows the user to select multiple recipients, and create USPS customs forms in a batch method.

## Code Diagram

TODO: Add a diagram here to help explain the organization of the code.



## Getting Started

### Set up your Sending Address, and Recipients

TODO: Add a description here on how to edit the recipients in the CSV file

Use a table format callout in the ReadMe file to help explain this


### Executing the Code

TODO: Add some description here to help tell the user how to run their code

### Original text description is below

A CSV file that includes the sender's address and a set of recipients accompanies the python files.

This CSV file functions as an address book, where the user can input a full list of potential recipeints.

Later in the python dialogs, the user has the ability to select a subset of this full list of recipients to send a package to, without having to edit the CSV address book.
