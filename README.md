# USPS Customs Form
A Python script using Selenium to batch-create USPS customs shipping forms.

## Project Description
When mailing multiple packages, navigating the USPS customs form creation web pages becomes a time-intensive task.

To help streamline the process, this method allows the user to select multiple recipients and create USPS customs forms in a batch method.

## Getting Started

A CSV file that includes the sender's address and a set of recipients accompanies the python files.

This CSV file functions as an address book, where the user can input a full list of potential recipeints.

Later in the python dialogs, the user has the ability to select a subset of this full list of recipients to send a package to, without having to edit the CSV address book.
